            	<h4>What is a rare disease?</h4>
            	<p>A rare disease is any disease that affects  a small percentage of the population. It is also called as 'orphan disease'.</p>
            	<p>Rarity means there is a lack of a market large enough to gain support and resources for discovering treatments for it, except by the government granting economically advantageous conditions to creating and selling such treatments. Orphan drugs are ones so created or sold.</p>
            	<p>Most rare diseases are genetic and thus present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Most rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30% of children with rare diseases will die before before reaching 5 years of age.</p>
            	<p>According to the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 of USA, a rare disease is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200000 people</p><br/>
            	<h4>How many rare diseases are there?</h4>
            	<p>There may be as many as 7000 rare diseases</p><br/>
            	<h4>What causes rare diseases? or Types of rare diseases</h4>
            	<p>The majority of rare diseases are caused by changes in genes or chromosomes. They may be inheritable and genetic. Other rare diseases include infecions, some rare cancers, and some autoimmune diseases</p><br/>
